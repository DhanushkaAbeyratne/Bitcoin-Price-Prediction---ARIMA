
My Project aims to observe past bitcoin values and trading patterns using different techniques to do predictions on bitcoin future values. 

The dataset which I am using for this project consist of 7 features and 4539 daily entries from 2013 to 2019. The dataset is extracted from the Kaggle competition.
