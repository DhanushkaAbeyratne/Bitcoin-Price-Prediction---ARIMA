My class project for the Metis Intro to Data Science 


My Project aims to observe past bitcoin values and trading patterns using different techniques to do predictions on bitcoin future values. 

The dataset which I am using for this project consist of 7 features and 4539 daily entries from 2013 to 2019. The dataset is extracted from the Kaggle competition. 

This project is expected to conduct technical analysis using methods such as finding correlations, moving averages and multi classification.

I would like to utilize the knowledge and techniques which I gained during this course to conduct technical analysis on any given financial dataset.
